# 💳 Credit Card Generator

A Swift-based credit card number generator that creates mathematically valid credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. This project demonstrates algorithm implementation, data validation, and clean code practices.

## ✨ What It Does

This tool provides a simple way to generate valid, fake credit card numbers for testing and educational purposes. It features:
- **Interactive Mode:** A user-friendly command-line interface that guides you through the generation process.
- **Multiple Card Types:** Support for major credit card networks with industry-standard IIN (Issuer Identification Number) ranges.
- **Complete Card Data:** Generates not just the card number, but also a random CVC and a future expiration date.
- **Luhn Algorithm Validation:** All generated numbers are mathematically valid according to the Luhn algorithm.
- **Smart Formatting:** Dynamic card number formatting based on card type (including special Diners Club formatting).
- **Mixed Card Generation:** Generate a random mix of all supported card types and save to file.
- **File Export:** Save generated cards to text files for easy access and testing.
- **Generation Limits:** Built-in 10,000 card generation limit to prevent system overload.
- **Robust Validation:** Input validation and error handling for safe operation.

## 🚀 Usage

This tool now runs in a user-friendly interactive mode by default. To start, simply run the script from your terminal:

```bash
swift CreditCardGenerator.swift
```

The script will then guide you through the process:

1.  **Welcome Message:** You will be greeted with a welcome message.
2.  **Select Card Type:** A menu of all supported card types will be displayed. Enter the number corresponding to your choice.
3.  **Enter Quantity:** You will be prompted to enter the number of cards you wish to generate (up to 10,000).
4.  **View Results:** The details of the generated cards will be printed to the console with proper formatting.
5.  **Continue or Exit:** You can then choose to generate more cards or exit the program.

### Mixed Card Generation (New Feature)

You can now generate a random mix of all supported card types and save them directly to a file:

1. **Select Option 8:** Choose "Generate Mixed Cards to File" from the main menu.
2. **Enter Quantity:** Specify how many cards you want to generate (up to 10,000).
3. **File Creation:** The script automatically creates a timestamped file (e.g., `credit_cards_20241024_143022.txt`).
4. **Random Distribution:** Cards are randomly distributed across all 7 supported card types.
5. **Automatic Save:** All generated cards are saved to the file with complete details.
